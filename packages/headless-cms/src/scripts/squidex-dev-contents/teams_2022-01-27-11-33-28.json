We will genetically engineer human embryonic stem cells to model the genetic alterations known to increase risk for Parkinson’s disease and turn those cells into disease-relevant cell types such as dopamine neurons. By profiling the gene expression changes caused by these known Parkinson’s disease risk variants, we will decipher the key molecular signatures that contribute to Parkinson’s disease. Once identified, we will confirm these genetic signatures in patient samples and validate their effects in animal models."

Here we propose to dissect the genetic, age-related, and cell-type-specific factors that lead to PD using a collection of genetically diverse stem cells derived from patients. Using advanced methods pioneered by our team, we will convert these stem cells into the different types of brain cells implicated in PD — neurons, microglia, and astrocytes — allowing us to investigate how genetic risk factors, the aging process, and these different cell types interact to trigger disease. We will assess how various combinations of these factors disrupt the function of brain cells using detailed molecular studies, microscopy, genetic manipulations, and biochemical measurements — building a computational network model of the factors that cause PD."

We will first look for evidence of transposable element activity using single-cell RNA sequencing of tissues from people with Parkinson’s disease. This particular experiment will also allow us to determine whether patient cells that show more transposable element activity also show increased signs of inflammation. Because cells of the central nervous system (neurons, astrocytes and microglia) can be grown in a laboratory culture system, we can also test whether manipulations that induce transposable element activity in these cells also causes an immune response that would result in inflammation. This would suggest that blocking transposon activity could block inflammation."

      "iv": "iNDI-PD will generate lines for 1-3 mutations in six well-studied PD/dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) genes. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing has been widely used to generate pairs of iPSC lines with and without mutations associated with human diseases that can then be differentiated into target cells in order to identify mutant-specific phenotypes. In principle, single point mutations can be introduced into non-disease lines and disease mutations can be reverted back to wild type, producing isogenic pairs of lines. While this has been performed at some scale for some diseases, there are only limited availability of lines for genes that cause Parkinson’s disease (PD), especially those variants that do not overlap with DLB, e.g., PINK1 and Parkin. Here, we will perform a series of editing manipulations for two series of iPSC-derived lines and will: a) provide the PD research community with a series of human isogenic iPSC lines expressing PD-associated mutations of interest on a common background (i.e., SNCA p.A30P, LRRK2 p.R1441C, p.Y1699C and p.I2020T, GBA p.E326K, three PINK1 and four PRKN variants); and b) provide the PD research community with isogenic controls for genetic PD patient-derived iPSC lines from the MJFF PPMI cohort."

We will determine the steps that occur in T cell activation in PD by examining T cells in blood from PD patients and healthy controls, and in the gut and brain of new mouse models of PD. To examine if these cell types are in human brain, we have developed new methods to detect signals in specific cells in autopsies of PD patients."

First, we will use novel mouse models of premature senescence to test whether premature senescence in specific cell types causes PD-like neuropathology. Second, we will combine mouse models of senescence and familial PD to test whether senescence participates in neuropathology caused by mutant PD-linked genes. Specifically, we will determine if pathology in a PD mouse model causes premature senescence and whether removing senescent cells from brain can prevent PD pathology. Finally, we will perform gene expression analysis of PD brains and mouse brains, at a single-cell level, to gain high-resolution insights about cellular processes that link aging and PD pathology."

First, we will investigate the molecular architecture of polyamine and glucosylceramide transporters and identify mechanisms to modulate their activity. Second, we will examine how these transporters influence the intracellular distribution of polyamine and glucosylceramide, and how this affects the cross-talk between lysosomes and mitochondria. Third, we will investigate how dysfunctional polyamine and glucosylceramide transporters affect other PD pathways, such as mitophagy, GBA1 and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and whether the modulation of these transporters can be validated as therapeutic approach for PD. Finally, we will collect evidence for disturbed polyamine and glucosylceramide transport in PD patients."

The study will leverage the existing PPMI infrastructure to ensure that a) data can easily be accessed by the research community through the study database portal; b) the already established Biospecimen Review Committee will quickly review and respond to applicants seeking access to banked samples; and c) analyses performed on the data and samples will be communicated to the ASAP CRN and the broader research community.

Herein we propose to create novel nonhuman primate models of co-pathology and inflammation through treatment with alpha synuclein preformed fibrils, AAV-tau, and beta amyloid via aging and transgenesis. We will validate these models by comparing our findings to inflammatory processes seen in human brain samples and refine exploration of the mechanisms involved by blocking these pathologies in mice and nonhuman primates using specific immunotherapies."

We aim to decipher what controls the activity of LRRK2 and to explore, in precise molecular detail, how this enzyme affects three major cellular structures (cilia, lysosomes and mitochondria) implicated in Parkinson’s disease. We showed that mutant LRRK2 triggers a series of molecular changes that cause new sets of proteins to interact. Our goal is to use a combination of state-of-the-art approaches to understand the consequences of these new interactions on the biology of three important subcellular compartments: primary cilia, lysosomes, and mitochondria."

      "iv": "We recently discovered that chains of the LRRK2 protein can wrap around cellular highways called “microtubules”. Our work suggests that LRRK2 blocks the cellular machines that move on these highways. We will explore the idea that mutations in LRRK2 cause PD by acting as roadblocks that change the normal transport of chemical information inside cells. We will test additional ideas that arise from the experiments we perform. Our collaborative team includes experts in cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET), small molecule synthesis, proteomics, and single-molecule and live-cell imaging. We will use our expertise to solve structures of multiple conformations and variants of LRRK2 to manipulate these different pools of LRRK2 and understand their cellular functions. We will determine how LRRK2 binds to microtubules and affects microtubule-based motors. We will also identify the protein interaction landscape of LRRK2 and test emergent cellular hypotheses resulting from this work, including whether LRRK2 regulates the transport of chemical information on microtubules."
